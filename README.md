kinectToTexturedOBJ
============

This uses openNI, but it should work with no problems with ofxKinect or whatever.

if you want to use this core right away you'll need to use gameoverhack's ofxOpenNi experimental branch:
https://github.com/gameoverhack/ofxOpenNI/tree/experimental

You'll also need kyle mcdonald's ofxCv addon:
https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv


Right now it's using a recorded ONI file to extract the depth and rgb data. An open file dialog will appear asking for an oni file.
